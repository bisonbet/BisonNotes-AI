# Repository Guidelines

## Project Structure & Module Organization
- Primary app code lives in `BisonNotes AI/` with feature folders such as `Models/`, `Views/`, `OpenAI/`, `AWS/`, `Wyoming/`, and `ViewModels/`.
- Watch companion sources are under `BisonNotes AI Watch App Watch App/`; keep shared logic in clear, reusable files.
- Unit and UI tests sit in `BisonNotes AITests/` and `BisonNotes AIUITests/`; watch-specific tests mirror the target folders.
- Assets live in `BisonNotes AI/Assets.xcassets`; app capabilities and settings are in `Info.plist` and `.entitlements`.

## Build, Test, and Development Commands
- `open "BisonNotes AI/BisonNotes AI.xcodeproj"` launches the workspace in Xcode.
- `xcodebuild -project "BisonNotes AI/BisonNotes AI.xcodeproj" -scheme "BisonNotes AI" -configuration Debug build` performs a Debug build of the iOS app.
- `xcodebuild test -project "BisonNotes AI/BisonNotes AI.xcodeproj" -scheme "BisonNotes AI" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15'` runs the iOS test suite.
- Use the corresponding watchOS scheme in Xcode to validate watch targets before merging.

## Coding Style & Naming Conventions
- Follow 4-space indentation with lines under 120 characters; keep one primary type per file.
- Use `UpperCamelCase` for types and files, `lowerCamelCase` for properties/functions, and enum cases in `lowerCamelCase`.
- Append `View`, `ViewModel`, `Manager`, or `Service` where applicable; align folder names with features.
- Prefer succinct comments explaining non-obvious logic; avoid redundant narration.

## Testing Guidelines
- XCTest powers unit and UI coverage; prioritize models, services, error paths, and integration seams.
- Mirror source names in test files, e.g., `SummaryManagerTests.swift`; group flows under `...UITests`.
- Run `xcodebuild test` before PRs and document any simulator or device caveats in the PR template.

## Commit & Pull Request Guidelines
- Use Conventional Commit prefixes (`feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`) with imperative, scoped messages.
- PRs should summarize changes, link issues via `Closes #123`, note simulator targets, and attach UI screenshots when applicable.
- Confirm the app builds for both iOS and watchOS schemes; include test evidence or rationale if coverage is deferred.

## Security & Configuration Tips
- Never commit API keys; rely on in-app settings for OpenAI and AWS credentials stored securely at runtime.
- Keep `Info.plist` and entitlements minimal and aligned with required capabilities (iCloud, Background Modes, Microphone).
- When adjusting background audio or sync, verify behavior on paired iOS and watchOS devices to avoid runtime regressions.
